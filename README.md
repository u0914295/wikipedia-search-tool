# wikipedia-search-tool

## Description
My application is a Wikipedia search tool designed to provide users with relevant information on their search queries. It is built to be responsive, interactive, and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices. 

My motivation for building this application was to make it easier for the user to find relevant information of a topic on Wikipedia. I built this project because it can be difficult to find information for example, a research paper, without knowing what related topics of information to search for. This solves the problem of doing seperate, time-consuming research to find the information that greatly improves your knowledge of a specific topic. 

From building this application, I learned just how valuable and powerful API's can be when utilized to build an application. Because of the generosity of certain programmers, other programmers are able to build on top of their work to produce amazing and revolutionary applications. 

## Installation
There is nothing to install for using the application. Simply unzip the folder after downloading the code within this repository and open the index.html file in your browser to start enjoying the search tool!

## Usage
Upon opening the search application (through opening of the index.html file in your browser), the following screen should appear:

From here, you can enter in the topic you want to find information on in the search bar. For example, if I were to search the topic "cats", the following would show:

Additionally, there is a history function that allows the user to see what they've previously searched for. This makes it easy to keep track of the topics you've already searched. Upon clicking the "history" button, your search history will appear as shown here:
